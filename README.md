Using Infracost and Checkov
===========================

This README guide will walk you through the steps of using Infracost and Checkov to optimize your Terraform infrastructure and ensure compliance with best practices. Infracost helps you estimate the cost of your Terraform resources, while Checkov helps you identify potential security and compliance issues in your infrastructure code.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before using Infracost and Checkov, make sure you have the following installed:

-   Terraform: Infracost and Checkov are meant to be used alongside Terraform, so ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine.
-   Python (for Checkov): Checkov is a Python-based tool, so you'll need Python installed, preferably version 3.6 or higher.

Installation
------------

### Infracost

Infracost is a Golang-based tool and can be installed using `go get`. Run the following command to install Infracost:



`go get github.com/infracost/infracost`

### Checkov

Checkov can be installed using Python's package manager, `pip`. Run the following command to install Checkov:



`pip install checkov`

Using Infracost
---------------

Infracost works by analyzing your Terraform plan and calculating the cost of the resources in that plan. To use Infracost, follow these steps:

1.  Change to the directory where your Terraform configuration files are located.

2.  Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.

3.  Run `terraform plan -out=tfplan.binary` to generate a Terraform plan.

4.  Run Infracost with the following command:



`infracost --tfplan=tfplan.binary`

Infracost will analyze the plan, fetch the latest prices from cloud providers, and display a cost breakdown of your resources.

Using Checkov
-------------

Checkov provides static analysis of your Terraform code to identify security and compliance issues. To use Checkov, follow these steps:

1.  Change to the directory where your Terraform configuration files are located.

2.  Run Checkov with the following command:



`checkov -d .`

Checkov will analyze your Terraform files and display any potential security or compliance issues found.

Example
-------

Let's take a simple example to demonstrate the usage of Infracost and Checkov:

hclCopy code

`# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}`

In this example, I have a Terraform configuration that creates an AWS EC2 instance and an S3 bucket. To analyze the cost using Infracost and check for compliance using Checkov, follow the steps mentioned in the respective sections.
